	<div id="about-text" class="general-popup mfp-hide">I was born and raised in the Bay, and am an aspiring data scientist, gym junkie, hip hop enthusiast, and animal lover. When I'm not in the gym, you can find me on Quora. My favorite foods are sushi and beef chow fun (shoutout to Dumpling Express in Berkeley!). I just finished my first year of college, and it's been a great ride. You can contact me through my email at rond24933chn@berkeley.edu.</div>
	<div id="swimming-text" class="general-popup mfp-hide">I’ve been a competitive swimmer for about 10 years, and during high school competed in Central Coast Sectionals all four years. My main events were the  <a href="http://www.fastlanetek.com/swmeets/2016_05_13_CCS/">100 breast, the breaststroke leg in the 200 medley relay,</a> and 100 fly. Many of my best memories from high school came from the amazing friends and team bonding from hours of grueling practice as well as singing along to songs on road trips. I also am a certified lifeguard and swim instructor at my local city sports center.</div>
	<div id="fitness-text" class="general-popup mfp-hide">I started lifting my freshman year, and my current goals are to bench 225 (currently 210) and deadlift 360 (currently 330), while weighing under 165. My favorite powerlifters are Pete Rubish and Russell Orhii, and my favorite bodybuilder is Evan Centopani. Here's a video of me <a href="https://youtu.be/1Jnq0kx3njU">deadlifting</a> 300x3, and this is a <a href="https://imgur.com/uVGoGP6"> progress photo</a> from 7/3. Youtubers I follow include Pete Rubish, Mark Bell, Russel Orhii, Elliot, Evan Centopani, and James Strickland.</div>
	<div id="hobbies-text" class="general-popup mfp-hide">I’m a HIMYM, Dragon Ball Super, and Big Bang Theory fanatic, and tend to get lost binging Chinese dramas haha. I also enjoy watching Conan's skits. My favorite Youtubers and vloggers include Lance Stewart, Serpentza, and Pete Rubish.</div>
	<div id="career-text" class="general-popup mfp-hide">During high school I was coordinator of the Tzu Chi Math Tutoring Program for underprivileged students. Here at Berkeley, I’ve been a lab assistant for The Foundations of Data Science for 2 semesters, and was also an edX alpha tester for its respective online course that was recently released to the entire world. I'm currently part of the education committee of the Statistics Undergrad Student Association, where we host data science workshops, and are working towards creating a DeCal for the spring.</div>
