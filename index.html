	<div id="about-text" class="general-popup mfp-hide">I was born and raised in the Bay, and am an aspiring data analyst. When I'm not in the gym, you can find me on Quora. My favorite foods are sushi and beef chow fun (Dumpling Express in Berkeley is a 10/10). I will be graduating this May from UC Berkeley and it's been a great ride. You can contact me through my email at rond24933chn@berkeley.edu.</div>
	<div id="swimming-text" class="general-popup mfp-hide">I used to swim competitvely for almost 10 years, and during high school competed in Central Coast Sectionals all four years. My main events were the  <a href="http://www.fastlanetek.com/swmeets/2016_05_13_CCS/">100 breast, the breaststroke leg in the 200 medley relay,</a> and 100 fly. Many of my best memories from high school came from the amazing friends and team bonding from hours of grueling practice as well as singing along to songs on road trips. I also am a certified lifeguard and swim instructor at the local city sports center.</div>
	<div id="fitness-text" class="general-popup mfp-hide">I recently started lifting with a focus on strength. My long term goals are to bench 275 pounds and deadlift 405 while weighing under 170; my recent lifts are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0iPx1CZw7cKRJLV1j2Mskw?view_as=subscriber">here</a>.
		<br><br>
				Strength athletes and people I look up to include Pete Rubish, Brian Shaw, and David Laid. </div>
	<div id="hobbies-text" class="general-popup mfp-hide"> In my spare time, I enjoy playing PUBG mobile competitively and am always on Discord chatting with friends. Some of my favorite shows are How I Met Your Mother and Dragon Ball Z. I also tend to get lost binging random Youtube vids and listening to Joe Rogan for hours on end. My favorite Youtubers include Tyler1, Quang Trang, and The Fung Bros. </div>
	<div id="career-text" class="general-popup mfp-hide">During high school I was coordinator of the Tzu Chi Math Tutoring Program for underprivileged students. Here at Berkeley, Iâ€™ve been a lab assistant for Data 8: The Foundations of Data Science for 2 semesters, and was a tester for the online edX course. I'm currently helping to create a DeCal (student run course) on data analysis, along with hosting programming workshops as part of the Statistics Undergrad Student Association Education Committee.
		<br><br>
		Recently I worked as part of team to model prices for zHealthEHR, an electronic health care company. Last year I was part of a data consulting team that optimized a stocking policy for Grandmark International, an automobile parts distributor.
		<br><br>
		I also worked on Project ATMA, an AI startup aiming to create a platform to automatically call 911 through real-time analysis of footage. Through this internship I've learned the basics of the Keras API and Tensorflow, as well as how the Google Cloud Platform works.

		A lot more info can be found in my resume.
