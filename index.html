	<div id="about-text" class="general-popup mfp-hide">I was born and raised in the Bay, and am an aspiring data scientist. When I'm not in the gym, you can find me on Quora. My favorite foods are sushi and beef chow fun (shoutout to Dumpling Express in Berkeley). I'm on my 4th year of college, and it's been a great ride. You can contact me through my email at rond24933chn@berkeley.edu.</div>
	<div id="swimming-text" class="general-popup mfp-hide">I’ve been a competitive swimmer for about 10 years, and during high school competed in Central Coast Sectionals all four years. My main events were the  <a href="http://www.fastlanetek.com/swmeets/2016_05_13_CCS/">100 breast, the breaststroke leg in the 200 medley relay,</a> and 100 fly. Many of my best memories from high school came from the amazing friends and team bonding from hours of grueling practice as well as singing along to songs on road trips. I also am a certified lifeguard and swim instructor at my local city sports center.</div>
	<div id="fitness-text" class="general-popup mfp-hide">I started lifting my freshman year, and didn't start focusing on strength until recently. My long term goals are to bench 275 pounds and deadlift 405 while weighing under 170; my recent lifts are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0iPx1CZw7cKRJLV1j2Mskw?view_as=subscriber">here</a>.
		<br><br>
				Strength athletes and people I look up to include Pete Rubish and David Laid. </div>
	<div id="hobbies-text" class="general-popup mfp-hide"> In my spare time, I enjoy playing PUBG mobile competitively and am always on Discord goofing around. I’m a HIMYM and Dragon Ball Z fanatic, and tend to get lost binging random Youtube vids. My favorite Youtubers include Serpentza, Quang Trang, and The Fung Bros. </div>
	<div id="career-text" class="general-popup mfp-hide">During high school I was coordinator of the Tzu Chi Math Tutoring Program for underprivileged students. Here at Berkeley, I’ve been a lab assistant for Data 8: The Foundations of Data Science for 2 semesters, and was an edX beta tester for the online course that was released to the public. I'm currently helping to create a DeCal (student run course) on Kaggle data analysis for the spring, along with hosting programming workshops as part of the Statistics Undergrad Student Association Education Committee.
		<br><br>
		Recently I worked part of a data consulting team to help create a new stocking policy for Grandmark, an automotive parts company.
		<br><br>
		I also worked with Project ATMA, an AI startup aiming to create an AI platform that can automatically call 911 through real-time analysis of security camera footage. We’re currently in the process of collecting videos of emergency footage to train ATMA to recognize such situations; through this internship I've learned the basics of the Keras API and Tensorflow, as well as how the Google Cloud Platform works.

		A lot more info can be found in my resume.
