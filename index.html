	<div id="about-text" class="general-popup mfp-hide">I was born and raised in the Bay, and am an aspiring computer and data scientist, gym rat, hip hop enthusiast, animal lover, and HIMYM fanatic. My favorite foods are sushi and beef chow fun (shoutout to Dumpling Express in Berkeley). I just finished my first year of college, and it's been a great ride. You can contact me through my email at rond24933chn@berkeley.edu.</div>
	<div id="swimming-text" class="general-popup mfp-hide">I’ve been a competitive swimmer for about 10 years, and during high school competed in Central Coast Sections all four years. I also lifeguard and am a swim instructor at my local city sports center during the summers.</div>
	<div id="fitness-text" class="general-popup mfp-hide">I started weightlifting since starting college, and am currently powerbuilding. My favorite bodybuilders are Ronnie Coleman and Evan Centopani. My favorite powerlifter is Pete Rubish, and my favorite strongman is Brian Shaw. My current goals are to bench 200 lbs for reps (currently at 185), and deadlift 315 lbs for reps (currently at 300).</div>
	<div id="hobbies-text" class="general-popup mfp-hide">I’m a HIMYM and Dragon Ball Super fanatic (the Mother shouldn’t have died and Android 17 is the goat). I find Conan to be the best talk show host, and I binge his skits for hours. I also watch Youtubers and vloggers such as Lance Stewart (one of the first Viners who now does pranks and daily vlogs), Serpentza (adventures through China and talks about its modern day conditions), and Filthy Frank (rip to the legend)</div>
	<div id="teaching-text" class="general-popup mfp-hide">During high school I was coordinator of the Tzu Chi Math Tutoring Program for underprivileged students. Here at Berkeley, I’ve been a lab assistant for The Foundations of Data Science, and was also an edX alpha tester for its respective online course that was recently released to the entire world.</div>
